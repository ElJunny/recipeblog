    <h1>Cosmic Waffle </h1>
    <p>So you want to learn how to make the cosmos treat, luckily you came to the right place! I will show you the ways on how to make a treat more delicious than an average waffle.</p>
<h1>The Gathering Of The Ingredients</h1>
<p>First you would want to gather the following ingredients from your local cosmic superstore: Blueberry waffles, Syrup, Whip Cream and Strawberry Slices. Next you would want to be sure to get the following tools for this project: Toaster, knife (butter) and napikins.</p>
<h1>The Cooking Phase</h1>
<p>First slide your blueberry waffles into the toaster on light as we do not intend to burn the waffles, second while the waffles are cooking start to wash and then cut starwberry's into slices be sure they are not too thin.</p>
<h1>The Assembly</h1>
<p>Once the waffles are done cooking add starwberry slices then add whip cream on top of the strawberry's then with all might close the waffle with another. Now you truly hold the masterpiece of the cosmos. Enjoy...</p>
